## Examples Overview  

I worked on a lot of projects dating back to my time at Nintendo that required NDAs to work with all of the teams. As a result of the NDAs, I made no personal copies of content. I have tracked most of the content that I initiated or heavily influenced; much of which have been removed or deprecated.  
For example, I wrote and marked-up the 1st release of the service specification documentation for the Microsoft Common File Binary (MS-CFB); after that time the release was replaced when Microsoft moved the service specifications to a different internal writing tool (DxEditor --> GenDox). This practice is not uncommon. I used several DITA-like CMRS at Microsoft. The following paragraphs describe the content that is on-line and that I was under a NDA at the time of initial release.  
While at my most recent contract with Aditi at Microsoft, I worked on the Azure Marketplace onboarding documentation. The content was delivered to a gitHub repository and parsed onto the Microsoft Docs pages. I overhauled and updated all of the pages loacted in the marketplace directory starting with the main page. 

*   AppSource and Azure Marketplace Publisher Guide
    *   [docs.microsoft.com/Azure/marketplace/marketplace-publishers-guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/Azure/marketplace/marketplace-publishers-guide)

While on contract with Aquent in a managed service role for Microsoft; I worked on the ASM-to-ARM (Web services-to-RESTful) conversion for SQL database requests on the Azure Platform.
At Amazon, I worked on a few APIs that were not made public and made updates to existing APIs. I used a DITA-like CMRS at Amazon. I wrote the following RESTful API content for the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) API, version 1.  
At AT&T, I rewrote the content for all of the REST APIs using a custom schema and Java-based parser for my 1st year. We then migrated all of the remaining REST APIs into a web deployment service. I used a DITA-like CMRS at AT&T. The remaining documentation for the REST APIs is as follows.  

*   In-App Messaging API, version 1 and 2  
    *   [developer.att.com/apis/in-app-messaging/docs](https://developer.att.com/apis/in-app-messaging/docs)  
*   OAuth 2.0 Authentication Management API, version 1, 2, and 3  
    *   [developer.att.com/apis/oauth-2/docs](https://developer.att.com/apis/oauth-2/docs)  
*   SMS API, version 2 and 3  
    *   [developer.att.com/apis/sms/docs](https://developer.att.com/apis/sms/docs) 
*   Error Codes  
    *   [developer.att.com/errors](https://developer.att.com/errors)  

Most of my wholly owned content dates back to my time at university (10 years ago).  
Most of my experience, since 1997, has been collaborating with an existing team or coordinating with a dedicated support (or subject matter) team.
